I will write here the process I followed to build this site. 
<br><br>
### `LEARNING`

My first approach was learn about Jekyll in the [official site][jekyll-home].
<br><br>
First I went through the [quickstart tutorial][quickstart-tutorial] to have my first approach but I honestly didn't learn anything but execute a few commands and magically get a website.
<br><br>
It is better to go directly to [Step by Step][step-by-step] tutorial. In this tutorial you will learn how manually build a static site with Jekyll and how to use (in a basic way) what Jekyll engine can offer you.
<br><br>
### `CHOOSING A THEME`

While I was following the tutorial I was building my own page. This first page is an example of everything learnt in the tutorial.
<br><br>
When I started this loog book I wanted to use a theme. Building my own is not an option since I am not good designer.
<br><br>
I looked a lot across [theme sources][theme-sources] in Jekyll site and the one a I liked the most was [Jamstack themes][jamstack-themes]
<br><br>
Here I could find [Dev Journal theme][devjournal-theme]. This theme is easy to use and it has small functionality but exactly what I need. Maybe I can contribute to the theme in the future.
