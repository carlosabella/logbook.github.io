I launch up this site with the purpose of centralized my personal mess regarding tech life. I want to have a unique place where I can take notes, explain thoughts and write experiences.

### `WHY JEKYLL`

Since I tried other tools as simple note apps, I think functionality is not enough for me. Having a website driven by a repository where I can write, explain and search whatever I need, looked good idea for me.

I chose [Jekyll][jekyll-home] because it is one of the most famous tool for static websites and its community is huge.
